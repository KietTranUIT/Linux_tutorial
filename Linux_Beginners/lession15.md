<h3> Sutting Down </h3>

The shutdown command arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way. All logged-in users are notified that the system is going down and within the last five minutes leading up to the shutdown, new logins are prevented.

The clock on our system may be set to a different timezone than the one in which you are located. To check the time in the terminal, use the date command.
